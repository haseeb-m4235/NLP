Logistic regression, despite its name, is a classification model rather than regression model. Logistic regression is a simple and more efficient method for binary and linear classification problems. It is a classification model, which is very easy to realize and achieves very good performance with linearly separable classes. It is an extensively employed algorithm for classification in industry. The logistic regression model, like the Adaline and perceptron, is a statistical method for binary classification that can be generalized to multiclass classification. Scikit-learn has a highly optimized version of logistic regression implementation, which supports multiclass classification task (Raschka, 2015).
Logistic regression is another powerful supervised ML algorithm used for binary classification problems (when target is categorical). The best way to think about logistic regression is that it is a linear regression but for classification problems. Logistic regression essentially uses a logistic function defined below to model a binary output variable (Tolles & Meurer, 2016). The primary difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that logistic regression's range is bounded between 0 and 1. In addition, as opposed to linear regression, logistic regression does not require a linear relationship between inputs and output variables. This is due to applying a nonlinear log transformation to the odds ratio (will be defined shortly).
Logistic regression is another fundamental method initially formulated by David Cox in 1958 that builds a logistic model (also known as the logit model). Its most significant advantage is that it can be used both for classification and class probability estimation, because it is tied with logistic data distribution. It takes a linear combination of features and applies to them a nonlinear sigmoidal function. In the basic version of logistic regression, the output variable is binary, however, it can be extended into multiple classes (then it is called multinomial logistic regression). The binary logistic model classifies specimen into two classes, whereas the multinomial logistic model extends this to an arbitrary number of classes without ordering them.

The mathematics of logistic regression rely on the concept of the “odds” of the event, which is a probability of an event occurring divided by the probability of an event not occurring. Just as in linear regression, logistic regression has weights associated with dimensions of input data. In contrary to linear regression, the relationship between the weights and the output of the model (the “odds”) is exponential, not linear.

One can say that the interpretability of logistic regression is not as easy as the interpretation of kNN or linear regression, but still much easier than more “black-box” models such as Neural Networks. The main obstacle is the multiplicative nature of the “odds.”

In QSAR toxicity modeling, logistic regression has found multiple applications. For example, Li et al. applied logistic regression to predict skin sensitization with use of data from murine Local Lymph Node Assay studies and similarity 4D-fingerprint descriptors. The training set consisted of 196 compounds, and the test set contained 22 compounds divided into four sensitizers classes: weak, moderate, strong, and extreme. The paper has shown that test set accuracy can vary strongly depending on the initial classification of the training set (whether we have separate classes for different strengths of sensitization, or we have a binary “weak or nonweak” classification). In this case, the approach with a smaller number of classes provided better accuracy. Logistic regression is also prone to restrictive expressiveness and complete separation. In cases when a feature correctly separating two classes in the first iteration is found, data are not separated further. This issue can be, however, solved by penalization of the weights or defining a prior probability distribution of weights. Ren et al. have compared logistic regression with another interpretable model, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model in aquatic toxicity prediction. They used experimental data and chemical structure-based descriptors calculated by the CODESSA and DRAGON software packages. Both models were validated internally and externally and LR has outperformed LDA for compounds that exhibit excess toxicity versus nonpolar narcotic compounds and for more reactive compounds versus less reactive compounds. Logistic regression was also used in consensus models with other techniques to increase prediction capabilities. In a study on QSAR nanotoxicity of nanoparticles in PaCa2 (pancreatic cancer cells), a consensus model consisting of logistic regression, Naïive Bayes, kNN, and SVM was developed with PADEL-Descriptor version 2.8 generated 1D and 2D chemical descriptors basing on SMILES, lipophilicity, and hydrogen bonding.
