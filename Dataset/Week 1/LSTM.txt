Text: <LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture widely used in Deep Learning. It excels at capturing long-term dependencies, making it ideal for sequence prediction tasks.

Unlike traditional neural networks, LSTM incorporates feedback connections, allowing it to process entire sequences of data, not just individual data points. This makes it highly effective in understanding and predicting patterns in sequential data like time series, text, and speech.

Introduction
Long Short-Term Memory Networks is a deep learning, sequential neural network that allows information to persist. It is a special type of Recurrent Neural Network which is capable of handling the vanishing gradient problem faced by RNN. LSTM was designed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber that resolves the problem caused by traditional rnns and machine learning algorithms. LSTM can be implemented in Python using the Keras library.

Let’s say while watching a video, you remember the previous scene, or while reading a book, you know what happened in the earlier chapter. RNNs work similarly; they remember the previous information and use it for processing the current input. The shortcoming of RNN is they cannot remember long-term dependencies due to vanishing gradient. LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid long-term dependency problems.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture widely used in Deep Learning. It excels at capturing long-term dependencies, making it ideal for sequence prediction tasks.

Unlike traditional neural networks, LSTM incorporates feedback connections, allowing it to process entire sequences of data, not just individual data points. This makes it highly effective in understanding and predicting patterns in sequential data like time series, text, and speech.

LSTM has become a powerful tool in artificial intelligence and deep learning, enabling breakthroughs in various fields by uncovering valuable insights from sequential data.
In the introduction to long short-term memory, we learned that it resolves the vanishing gradient problem faced by RNN, so now, in this section, we will see how it resolves this problem by learning the architecture of the LSTM. At a high level, LSTM works very much like an RNN cell. Here is the internal functioning of the LSTM network.
The first part chooses whether the information coming from the previous timestamp is to be remembered or is irrelevant and can be forgotten. In the second part, the cell tries to learn new information from the input to this cell. At last, in the third part, the cell passes the updated information from the current timestamp to the next timestamp. This one cycle of LSTM is considered a single-time step.

These three parts of an LSTM unit are known as gates. They control the flow of information in and out of the memory cell or lstm cell. The first gate is called Forget gate, the second gate is known as the Input gate, and the last one is the Output gate. An LSTM unit that consists of these three gates and a memory cell or lstm cell can be considered as a layer of neurons in traditional feedforward neural network, with each neuron having a hidden layer and a current state.

Just like a simple RNN, an LSTM also has a hidden state where H(t-1) represents the hidden state of the previous timestamp and Ht is the hidden state of the current timestamp. In addition to that, LSTM also has a cell state represented by C(t-1) and C(t) for the previous and current timestamps, respectively.

Here the hidden state is known as Short term memory, and the cell state is known as Long term memory.
It is interesting to note that the cell state carries the information along with all the timestamps. >
