The field of meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, has seen a dramatic increase in interest in recent years. Unlike conventional approaches to AI, where tasks are solved from scratch using a fixed learning algorithm, meta-learning aims to improve the algorithm, considering the experience of multiple learning episodes. This paradigm provides an opportunity to address many of the conventional challenges of deep learning, including data and computational bottlenecks and generalization. This survey describes the current landscape of meta-learning. We first discuss definitions of meta-learning and situate them concerning related fields such as transfer learning and hyperparameter optimization. We then propose a new taxonomy that provides a more comprehensive partitioning of the space of today’s meta-learning methods. We explore meta-learning’s promising applications and achievements, such as multiple trials and reinforcement learning.
The performance of a learning model depends on its training dataset, algorithm, and parameters. Many experiments are needed to find the best performing algorithm and algorithm parameters. Meta-learning approaches help them find and optimize the number of experiments. The result is better predictions in less time.
Meta-learning can be used for various machine learning models (e.g., few-shot, Reinforcement Learning, natural language processing, etc.). Meta-learning algorithms make predictions by inputting the outputs and metadata of machine learning algorithms. Meta-learning algorithms can learn to use the best predictions from machine learning algorithms to make better predictions. In computer science, meta-learning studies and approaches started in the 1980s and became popular after the works of Jürgen Schmidhuber and Yoshua Bengio on the subject.
Meta-learning, described as “learning to learn”, is a subset of machine learning in the field of computer science. It is used to improve the results and performance of the learning algorithm by changing some aspects of the learning algorithm based on the results of the experiment. Meta-learning helps researchers understand which algorithms generate the best/better predictions from datasets.
Meta-learning algorithms use learning algorithm metadata as input. They then make predictions and provide information about the performance of these learning algorithms as output. An image’s metadata in a learning model can include, for example, its size, resolution, style, creation date, and owner.
Systematic experiment design in meta-learning is the most important challenge.
Machine learning algorithms have some problems, such as
The need for large datasets for training
High operating costs due to many trials/experiments during the training phase
Experiments/trials take a long time to find the best model that performs best for a given data set.
Meta-learning can help machine learning algorithms deal with these challenges by optimizing and finding learning algorithms that perform better.
Interest in meta-learning has been growing over the last five years, especially after 2017, it accelerated. As the use of deep learning and advanced machine learning algorithms has increased, the difficulty of training these algorithms has increased interest in meta-learning studies.
