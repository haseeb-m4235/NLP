Word embedding or word vector is an approach with which we represent documents and words. It is defined as a numeric vector input that allows words with similar meanings to have the same representation. It can approximate meaning and represent a word in a lower dimensional space. These can be trained much faster than the hand-built models that use graph embeddings like WordNet.

For instance, a word embedding with 50 values holds the capability of representing 50 unique features. Many people choose pre-trained word embedding models like Flair, fastText, SpaCy, and others.

We will discuss it further in the article. Let’s move on to learn it briefly with an example of the same.
Given a supervised learning task to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not (classification). Here the independent variable would be the tweets (text) and the target variable would be the binary values (1: Real Disaster, 0: Not real Disaster).

Now, Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms only take numeric input. So, how do we convert tweets to their numeric values? We will dive deep into the techniques to solve such problems, but first let’s look at the solution provided by word embedding.
Word Embeddings in NLP is a technique where individual words are represented as real-valued vectors in a lower-dimensional space and captures inter-word semantics. Each word is represented by a real-valued vector with tens or hundreds of dimensions.
Term frequency-inverse document frequency is the machine learning algorithm that is used for word embedding for text. It comprises two metrics, namely term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).

This algorithm works on a statistical measure of finding word relevance in the text that can be in the form of a single document or various documents that are referred to as corpus.

The term frequency (TF) score measures the frequency of words in a particular document. In simple words, it means that the occurrence of words is counted in the documents.

The inverse document frequency or the IDF score measures the rarity of the words in the text. It is given more importance over the term frequency score because even though the TF score gives more weightage to frequently occurring words, the IDF score focuses on rarely used words in the corpus that may hold significant information.

TF-IDF algorithm finds application in solving simpler natural language processing and machine learning problems for tasks like information retrieval, stop words removal, keyword extraction, and basic text analysis. However, it does not capture the semantic meaning of words efficiently in a sequence.
