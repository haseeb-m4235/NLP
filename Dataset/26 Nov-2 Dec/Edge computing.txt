Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth. Take for example the popular content streaming service Netflix. Netflix has a powerful recommendation system to suggest movies for you to watch. It also hosts an extraordinary amount of content on its servers that it needs to distribute. As Netflix scales up to more customers in more countries, its infrastructure becomes strained. Edge Computing can make this system more efficient. We’ll begin with the two major paradigms within Edge Computing: edge intelligence and the intelligent edge.
More connected devices are being introduced to us by the day. Our phones, computers, tablets, game consoles, wearables, appliances, and vehicles are all gaining varying levels of intelligence — meaning they can communicate with other devices or perform computations to make decisions. This is edge intelligence. You might ask why this is important at all, but it turns out that as our products and services become more complex and sophisticated, new problems arise from latency, privacy, scalability, energy cost, or reliability perspectives. Use of edge intelligence is one way we can address these concerns. Edge intelligence brings a lot of the compute workload closer to the user, keeping information more secure, delivering content faster, and lessening the workload on centralized servers.
Much like edge intelligence, the intelligent edge brings content delivery and machine learning closer to the user. Unlike edge intelligence, the intelligent edge introduces new infrastructure in a location convenient to the end user or end device. Let’s take our Netflix example again. Netflix has its headquarters in California, but wants to serve New York City, which is almost 5000 kilometers away. Combine latency with the time it takes to compute a recommended selection of movies for the millions of users, and you’ve got a pretty subpar service. The intelligent edge can fix this!
Instead of having an enormous datacenter with every single Netflix movie stored on it, let’s say we have a smaller datacenter with the top 10,000 movies stored on it, and just enough compute power to serve the population of New York City (rather than enough to serve all of the United States). Let’s also say we’ll build 5 of these data centers — one for each borough of New York City (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island) — so that the data center is even closer to the end user and if one server needs maintenance, we have backups. What have we just done? We’ve introduced new infrastructure, albeit with less power, but just enough to provide an even better experience to the end user than by using the most powerful systems centralized in one location. The idea of edge intelligence is scalable too, we can imagine this on a country-wide scale or on the scale as simple as a single warehouse.
DNNs (general DL models) can extract latent data features, while DRL can learn to deal with decision-making problems by interacting with the environment. With regard to various edge management issues such as edge caching, offloading, communication, security protection, etc., 1) DNNs can process user information and data metrics in the network, as well as per- ceiving the wireless environment and the status of edge nodes, and based on these information 2) DRL can be applied to learn the long-term optimal resource management and task schedul- ing strategies, so as to achieve the intelligent management of the edge, viz., or intelligent edge.
This leaves significant room for open-endedness — where we can apply DNNs or DRL for resource management such as caching (i.e. reducing redundant data transmissions), task offloading, or maintenance.
