Adversarial machine learning is a machine learning method that aims to trick machine learning models by providing deceptive input. Hence, it includes both the generation and detection of adversarial examples, which are inputs specially created to deceive classifiers. Such attacks, called adversarial machine learning, have been extensively explored in some areas, such as image classification and spam detection
The most extensive studies of adversarial machine learning have been conducted in the area of image recognition, where modifications are performed on images that cause a classifier to produce incorrect predictions.
An adversarial attack is a method to generate adversarial examples. Hence, an adversarial example is an input to a machine learning model that is purposely designed to cause a model to make a mistake in its predictions despite resembling a valid input to a human. 
A whitebox attack is a scenario where the attacker has complete access to the target model, including the model’s architecture and its parameters. A blackbox attack is a scenario where an attacker has no access to the model and can only observe the outputs of the targeted model.
With machine learning rapidly becoming core to organizations’ value proposition, the need for organizations to protect them is growing fast. Hence, Adversarial Machine Learning is becoming an important field in the software industry. Google, Microsoft, and IBM have started to invest in securing machine learning systems. In recent years, companies are heavily investing in machine learning themselves – Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla – faced some degree of adversarial attacks.
Moreover, governments start to implement security standards for machine learning systems, with the European Union even releasing a complete checklist to assess the trustworthiness of machine learning systems (Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence – ALTAI). Gartner, a leading industry market research firm, advised that “application leaders must anticipate and prepare to mitigate potential risks of data corruption, model theft, and adversarial samples”. Recent studies show that the security of today’s AI systems is of high importance to businesses. However, the emphasis is still on traditional security. Organizations seem to lack the tactical knowledge to secure machine learning systems in production. The adoption of a production-grade AI system drives the need for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML).
There are a large variety of different adversarial attacks that can be used against machine learning systems. Many of these work on deep learning systems and traditional machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and linear regression. Most adversarial attacks usually aim to deteriorate the performance of classifiers on specific tasks, essentially to “fool” the machine learning algorithm. Adversarial machine learning is the field that studies a class of attacks that aims to deteriorate the performance of classifiers on specific tasks. Adversarial attacks can be mainly classified into the following categories: Poisoning Attacks, Evasion Attacks Model and Extraction Attacks.
The attacker influences the training data or its labels to cause the model to underperform during deployment. Hence, Poisoning is essentially adversarial contamination of training data. As ML systems can be re-trained using data collected during operation, an attacker may poison the data by injecting malicious samples during operation, which subsequently disrupt or influence re-training
Evasion attacks are the most prevalent and most researched types of attacks. The attacker manipulates the data during deployment to deceive previously trained classifiers. Since they are performed during the deployment phase, they are the most practical types of attacks and the most used attacks on intrusion and malware scenarios. The attackers often attempt to evade detection by obfuscating the content of malware or spam emails. Therefore, samples are modified to evade detection as they are classified as legitimate without directly impacting the training data. Examples of evasion are spoofing attacks against biometric verification systems.  
Model stealing or model extraction involves an attacker probing a black box machine learning system in order to either reconstruct the model or extract the data it was trained on. This is especially significant when either the training data or the model itself is sensitive and confidential. Model extraction attacks can be used, for instance, to steal a stock market prediction model, which the adversary could use for their own financial benefit.
Adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models that an attacker has purposely designed to cause the model to make a mistake. An adversarial example is a corrupted version of a valid input, where the corruption is done by adding a perturbation of a small magnitude to it. This barely noticed nuisance is designed to deceive the classifier by maximizing the probability of an incorrect class. The adversarial example is designed to appear “normal” to humans but causes misclassification by the targeted machine learning model. Following, we list some of the known current techniques for generating adversarial examples.
