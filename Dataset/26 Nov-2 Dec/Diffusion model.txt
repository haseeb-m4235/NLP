In machine learning, diffusion models, also known as diffusion probabilistic models or score-based generative models, are a class of generative models. The goal of diffusion models is to learn a diffusion process that generates the probability distribution of a given dataset. It mainly consists of three major components: the forward process, the reverse process, and the sampling procedure. Three examples of generic diffusion modeling frameworks used in computer vision are denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations.

Diffusion models can be applied to a variety of tasks, including image denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, and image generation. For example, in image generation, a neural network is trained to denoise images with added gaussian noise by learning to remove the noise. After the training is complete, it can then be used for image generation by supplying an image composed of random noise for the network to denoise.

Diffusion models have been applied to generate many kinds of real-world data, the most famous of which are text-conditional image generators like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion. More examples are in a later section in the article.

Diffusion models were introduced in 2015 as a method to learn a model that can sample from a highly complex probability distribution. They used techniques from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, especially diffusion.
Consider, for example, how one might model the distribution of all naturally-occurring photos. Each image is a point in the space of all images, and the distribution of naturally-occurring photos is a "cloud" in space, which, by repeatedly adding noise to the images, diffuses out to the rest of the image space, until the cloud becomes all but indistinguishable from a Gaussian distribution N(0,I). A model that can approximately undo the diffusion can then be used to sample from the original distribution. This is studied in "non-equilibrium" thermodynamics, as the starting distribution is not in equilibrium, unlike the final distribution.
