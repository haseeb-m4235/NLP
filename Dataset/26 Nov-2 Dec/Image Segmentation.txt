Image Segmentation is an extension of image classification, a computer vision technique used to understand what is at the pixel level in an image, in addition to classifying the information in the image. It outlines the boundaries of objects to find out what they are, where they are, and how to detect individual object detection to individually labeling different regions in an image.

Image segmentation is one of the most important fields, especially in computer vision. In machine learning, image segmentation refers to the process of separating data into discrete groups. In deep learning, image segmentation is all about creating a segment map that associates labels or categories with every pixel in an image, for example, for self-driving cars to identify vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, and other roadways.
mage segmentation is a subdomain of computer vision and digital image processing. It aims to group similar regions or segments of an image into their respective class labels.
Image segmentation is also an extension of image classification, where in addition to classification, you can show the relationships of objects to pinpoint where they are. To summarize
Image Classification: Give only one piece of information about the entire image.
Image Segmentation: Assign boundaries within an image and label independent information about those boundaries.
Video segmentation is the task of segmenting a video into different regions based on characteristics such as object boundaries, motion, color, texture, or other visual features. The goal of video segmentation is to identify and separate different objects from the background and temporal events in a video to provide a more detailed and structured representation of the visual content.
Video segmentation is a very important task in the field of computer vision and multimedia because it allows for the identification and characterization of individual objects and events in a video, as well as the organization and classification of video content.

‍Segmentation is a key technique in machine learning that allows you to divide data into groups with similar characteristics. Segmentation makes AI models more accurate and efficient, and can be used to improve performance.

Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning a class label to every single pixel in an input image. The resources below will help you understand the differences between the different ways of working with computer vision.
Semantic segmentation is a type of image segmentation that assigns a semantic label to each pixel in an image, meaning that each pixel is assigned a label that describes its content, such as "road", "tree", or "building".
Semantic segmentation is based on the principle that the content of an image can be divided into several semantic classes. These semantic classes can then be used to identify and track objects in the image. Semantic Segmentation is used in Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning. In the former, you train a machine learning model on a dataset of manually semantically labeled images and then let it do the work. The latter doesn't require a labeled image dataset, but uses a variety of methods to learn the labels of images without any prior knowledge.
Semantic Segmentation Networks started out as a slight modification of image classification models. The first successful Semantic segmentation Network started with a fully convolutional network (FCN), and now there are many different architectures with many small and large improvements. Some of the most talked about Semantic segmentation models in recent years are DeepLab, FastFCN, DeepLabV3, and Transformer-based models.
Instance segmentation is a type of image segmentation that identifies and segments individual objects in an image, meaning it assigns a unique label to each object in the image and can also identify the boundaries of each object.
Instance segmentation is the ability to identify and segment individual objects in an image based on their appearance or context. Recently, its applicability has emerged in various fields and it is affecting our daily lives. Generally, instance segmentation is built on the Mask R-CNN Architecture model.
Techniques for performing instance segmentation can be divided into two categories.
Bottom-up method: It starts by detecting individual pixels in an image, and then groups them together to form an object.
Top-down method: Detect the entire scene in the image, identify individual objects, and segment them.
