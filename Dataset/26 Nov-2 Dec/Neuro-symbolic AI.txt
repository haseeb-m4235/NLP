Neuro-symbolic AI is a type of artificial intelligence that integrates neural and symbolic AI architectures to address the weaknesses of each, providing a robust AI capable of reasoning, learning, and cognitive modeling. As argued by Valiantand others, the effective construction of rich computational cognitive models demands the combination of symbolic reasoning and efficient machine learning. Gary Marcus, argued, "We cannot construct rich cognitive models in an adequate, automated way without the triumvirate of hybrid architecture, rich prior knowledge, and sophisticated techniques for reasoning." Further, "To build a robust, knowledge-driven approach to AI we must have the machinery of symbol manipulation in our toolkit. Too much useful knowledge is abstract to proceed without tools that represent and manipulate abstraction, and to date, the only known machinery that can manipulate such abstract knowledge reliably is the apparatus of symbol manipulation."

Henry Kautz,Francesca Rossi, and Bart Selman also argued for a synthesis. Their arguments attempt to address the two kinds of thinking, as discussed in Daniel Kahneman's book Thinking Fast and Slow. It describes cognition as encompassing two components: System 1 is fast, reflexive, intuitive, and unconscious. System 2 is slower, step-by-step, and explicit. System 1 is used for pattern recognition. System 2 handles planning, deduction, and deliberative thinking. In this view, deep learning best handles the first kind of cognition while symbolic reasoning best handles the second kind. Both are needed for a robust, reliable AI that can learn, reason, and interact with humans to accept advice and answer questions. Such dual-process models with explicit references to the two contrasting systems have been worked on since the 1990s, both in AI and in Cognitive Science, by multiple researchers.
In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), recent advances in deep learning and big data have resulted in artificial neural networks attaining industrial relevance in a wide range of applications. Neural networks are now the state-of-the-art in language modeling, speech and image classification, sensor data and graph analytics, time series forecasting, and many more tasks requiring the processing of unstructured large data. By contrast, symbolic AI relies on the formalization of knowledge bases and rule-based algorithmic approaches, modeling sound and well-understood reasoning based on expert knowledge. This offers better explanations of AI via knowledge representations that can be inspected to interpret how decisions follow from inputs. However, this is challenged by unstructured large data. Neural and symbolic approaches to AI also provide deeper insights into resolving problems at which they excel. For example, deep learning excels at scene recognition, but it does not achieve state-of-the-art performance at planning, rich deductive reasoning, or complex symbol manipulation.
Neurosymbolic AI is an emerging field of AI aiming to build rich computational AI models, systems and applications by combining neural and symbolic learning and reasoning. It seeks to combine the complementary strengths of neural and symbolic AI while overcoming their respective weaknesses, either in the form of principled integration between both paradigms and forms of representation or in the form of hybrid systems combining neural and symbolic components in one architecture.
AI has vast potential, some of which has been realised by developments in deep learning methods. However, it has become clear that these approaches have reached an impasse and that such “sub-symbolic” or “neuro-inspired” techniques only work well for certain classes of problem and are generally opaque to both analysis and understanding. On the other hand, “symbolic” AI techniques, based on rules, logic and reasoning, while not as efficient as “sub-symbolic” approaches, have much better behaviour in terms of transparency, explainability, verifiability and, indeed, trustworthiness. A new direction described as “neuro-symbolic” AI has been suggested, combining the efficiency of “sub-symbolic” AI with the transparency of “symbolic” AI. This combination can potentially provide a new wave of AI tools and systems that are both interpretable and elaboration tolerant and can integrate reasoning and learning in a very general way.
This approach provides a bridge between low-level, data intensive, perception and high-level, logical, reasoning and promises a future generation of AI tools that are not only efficient but transparent, reliable and trustworthy. This will provide an opportunity to take a step beyond the current orthodoxy of “data-driven” machine learning and to develop a hybrid approach that is much more acceptable to the public (since transparency and explainability are straightforward), to regulators (since verifiability and assurance are both viable within “symbolic” components) and industry (since this approach can help move practical AI and autonomous systems out of their “dead end” towards broader and more sophisticated applicability). Without a step change in the way AI systems are devised, then not only AI tools, but “driverless” cars, domestic robotics, and a range of robots deployed in distant environments will continue to under-deliver. Overall, this step-change will remain unlikely.
