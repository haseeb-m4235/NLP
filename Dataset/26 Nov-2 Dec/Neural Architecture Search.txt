Neural Architecture Search is a subfield of automated machine learning (AutoML), so let’s first understand what that is. Also referred to as automated ML, AutoML is an overarching term that relates to the process of automating the different tasks involved in applying machine learning to real-world problems.
Starting from a raw dataset to deploying a production-ready model, every stage of the traditional machine learning model development has components that are time-consuming, resource-intensive, complex, and iterative.
Using AI-based methods to automate the process of machine learning development, can significantly shorten the time to production. When it comes to classical machine learning algorithms  ( e.g. random forests and neural networks), AutoML tools are used to simplify the model selection and choice of training hyperparameters. Examples of AutoML libraries include AutoWEKA, auto-sklearn, and AutoML.org.
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful architectures but they are hard and time consuming to develop. There are numerous ways to structure and modify a neural network. In order to achieve the ultimate performance, there are various elements to consider including layer types, operations, and activation functions as well as the training data and deployment considerations (runtime, memory, and the inference hardware and its computational constraints).
Finding the most suitable deep learning architecture is a process that involves many trial and error iterations. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides an alternative to the manual designing of DNNs.
A subfield of automated ML, NAS is a technique that can help discover the best neural networks for a given problem. It automates the designing of DNNs, ensuring higher performance and lower losses than manually designed architectures. It is also much faster than the traditional manual processes.
The general idea behind NAS is to select the optimal architecture from a space of allowable architectures. The selection algorithm relies on a search strategy, which in turn depends on an objective evaluation scheme. The popular convolutional neural network EfficientNet is an example of an architecture generated by NAS.
Neural architecture search is a growing area in deep learning research that aims to deliver better performing models and applications. However, it can still be challenging to implement. To further understand how NAS works, let’s dive into its components.
Neural Architecture Search has three main building blocks that can be categorized in terms of search space, search strategy/algorithm, and evaluation strategy (Elsken et al., 2019). Each of these components can utilize different methods.
The NAS search space determines what type of architecture can be discovered by the NAS algorithm. It is defined by a set of operations that specify the overall structure (skeleton) of the network, the type of units or blocks that define the layers, as well as the allowable connectivity between layers to create architectures.
The more elements the search space has, the more complex and versatile it gets. But naturally, as the search space expands, the costs of finding the best architecture also increase. Types of operations used in defining the search space include sequential layer-wise operations, cell-based representation, hierarchical structure, and more.
The search strategy determines how the NAS algorithm experiments with different neural networks. How does it work in general? From a sample of the population of network candidates, the algorithm optimizes the child model performance metrics as rewards to create the output of high performance architecture candidates.
There are various methods that optimize search strategies to make the process deliver better results faster and with consistency. Types of search algorithms include random search, neuro-evolutionary methods (Elsken et al., 2019), Bayesian approaches (Mendoza et al., 2016), and reinforcement learning (Zoph and Le, 2016).
Some recent evidence suggests that evolutionary techniques perform just as well as reinforcement learning (Real et al., 2019). Moreover, the evolutionary methods tend to have better “anytime performance” and settle on smaller models. While earlier NAS techniques were based on discrete search spaces, a continuous formulation of the architecture search space has introduced differentiable search methods, which opened the way for gradient based optimization (Liu et al., 2019).
During a NAS search, the algorithm trains, evaluates, validates, and compares performance before choosing the optimal neural network. Full training on each neural network typically requires a long time and high compute demand – thousands of GPU days.
To reduce the costs of evaluating deep learning models, several strategies can be used (Jin et al., 2019), including:Proxy task performance,Low-fidelity performance estimation – early exit after a few epochs, training over a subset of the data, downscaled models or data,Weight inheritance,Weight sharing,Learning-curve extrapolation and Network morphism
It’s expensive to run search and evaluation independently for a large population of child models. To address this, another group of NAS methods, under the umbrella of one-shot architecture search, include a search space of sub-architectures belonging to a single super-architecture with trained weights that are shared among all sub-models (Xie et al., 2019). One-shot methods differ according to how the one-shot model is trained.
Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) by Pham et al. (2018) is a prominent example of a single-shot algorithm that achieves a 1000X speedup of the search relative to previous techniques. One of the prominent results in this venue is the “once for all” technique (Cai et al., 2019).
