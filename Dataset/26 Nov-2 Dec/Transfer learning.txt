In transfer learning, the knowledge of an already trained machine learning model is applied to a different but related problem. For example, if you trained a simple classifier to predict whether an image contains a backpack, you could use the knowledge that the model gained during its training to recognize other objects like sunglasses.
With transfer learning, we basically try to exploit what has been learned in one task to improve generalization in another. We transfer the weights that a network has learned at “task A” to a new “task B.”
The general idea is to use the knowledge a model has learned from a task with a lot of available labeled training data in a new task that doesn't have much data. Instead of starting the learning process from scratch, we start with patterns learned from solving a related task.
Transfer learning is mostly used in computer vision and natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis due to the huge amount of computational power required.
Transfer learning isn’t really a machine learning technique, but can be seen as a “design methodology” within the field, for example, active learning. It is also not an exclusive part or study-area of machine learning. Nevertheless, it has become quite popular in combination with neural networks that require huge amounts of data and computational power.
In computer vision, for example, neural networks usually try to detect edges in the earlier layers, shapes in the middle layer and some task-specific features in the later layers. In transfer learning, the early and middle layers are used and we only retrain the latter layers. It helps leverage the labeled data of the task it was initially trained on.
Let’s go back to the example of a model trained for recognizing a backpack on an image, which will be used to identify sunglasses. In the earlier layers, the model has learned to recognize objects, because of that we will only retrain the latter layers so it will learn what separates sunglasses from other objects.
In transfer learning, we try to transfer as much knowledge as possible from the previous task the model was trained on to the new task at hand. This knowledge can be in various forms depending on the problem and the data. For example, it could be how models are composed, which allows us to more easily identify novel objects.
Transfer learning has several benefits, but the main advantages are saving training time, better performance of neural networks (in most cases), and not needing a lot of data. 
Usually, a lot of data is needed to train a neural network from scratch but access to that data isn't always available — this is where transfer learning comes in handy. With transfer learning a solid machine learning model can be built with comparatively little training data because the model is already pre-trained. This is especially valuable in natural language processing because mostly expert knowledge is required to create large labeled data sets. Additionally, training time is reduced because it can sometimes take days or even weeks to train a deep neural network from scratch on a complex task.
If the original model was trained using an open-source library like TensorFlow, you can simply restore it and retrain some layers for your task. Keep in mind, however, that transfer learning only works if the features learned from the first task are general, meaning they can be useful for another related task as well. Also, the input of the model needs to have the same size as it was initially trained with. If you don’t have that, add a pre-processing step to resize your input to the needed size
