Backpropagation, or backward propagation of errors, is an algorithm that is designed to test for errors working back from output nodes to input nodes. It's an important mathematical tool for improving the accuracy of predictions in data mining and machine learning. Essentially, backpropagation is an algorithm used to quickly calculate derivatives in a neural network, which are the changes in output because of tuning and adjustments.
There are two leading types of backpropagation networks:
Static backpropagation: Static backpropagation is a network developed to map static inputs for static outputs. Static networks can solve static classification problems, such as optical character recognition (OCR).
Recurrent backpropagation: The recurrent backpropagation network is used for fixed-point learning. This means that during neural network training, the weights are numerical values that determine how much nodes -- also referred to as neurons -- influence output values. They're adjusted so that the network can achieve stability by reaching a fixed value.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep neural networks use backpropagation as a learning algorithm to compute a gradient descent, which is an optimization algorithm that guides the user to the maximum or minimum of a function.
In a machine learning context, the gradient descent helps the system minimize the gap between desired outputs and achieved system outputs. The algorithm tunes the system by adjusting the weight values for various inputs to narrow the difference between outputs. This is also known as the error between the two.
More specifically, a gradient descent algorithm uses a gradual process to provide information on how a network's parameters need to be adjusted to reduce the disparity between the desired and achieved outputs. An evaluation metric called a cost function guides this process. The cost function is a mathematical function that measures this error. The algorithm's goal is to determine how the parameters must be adjusted to reduce the cost function and improve overall accuracy.
In backpropagation, this error is propagated backward from the output layer or output neuron through the hidden layers toward the input layer so that neurons can adjust themselves along the way if they played a role in producing the error. Activation functions activate neurons to learn new complex patterns, information and whatever else they need to adjust their weights and biases, and mitigate this error to improve the network.
Backpropagation algorithms are used extensively to train feedforward neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks, in areas such as deep learning. A backpropagation algorithm is pragmatic because it computes the gradient needed to adjust a network's weights more efficiently than computing the gradient based on each individual weight. It enables the use of gradient methods, such as gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, to train multilayer networks and update weights to minimize errors.
It's not easy to understand exactly how changing weights and biases affect the overall behavior of an ANN. That was one factor that held back more comprehensive use of neural network applications until the early 2000s, when computers provided the necessary insight.
Today, backpropagation algorithms have practical applications in many areas of artificial intelligence, including OCR, natural language processing and image processing.
Backpropagation is a type of supervised learning since it requires a known, desired output for each input value to calculate the loss function gradient, which is how desired output values differ from actual output. Supervised learning, the most common training approach in machine learning, uses a training data set that has clearly labeled data and specified desired outputs.
Along with classifier algorithms such as naive Bayesian filters, K-nearest neighbors and support vector machines, the backpropagation training algorithm has emerged as an important part of machine learning applications that involve predictive analytics. While backpropagation techniques are mainly applied to neural networks, they can also be applied to both classification and regression problems in machine learning. In real-world applications, developers and machine learning experts implement backpropagation algorithms for neural networks using programming languages such as Python.
