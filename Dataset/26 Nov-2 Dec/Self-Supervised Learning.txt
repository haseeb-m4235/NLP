Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a machine learning (ML) training format and a range of methods that encourage a model to train from unlabeled data. 
Instead of a model relying on large volumes of labeled and annotated data (in the case of supervised learning), it generates labels for the data based on the unstructured inputs.
In computer vision (CV), you could train an ML model using greyscale images, or half an image, so that it will accurately predict the other half or what colors go where. 
Self-supervised learning is particularly useful in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), where the amount of labeled data required to train models can be prohibitively large. Training models on less data using a self-supervised approach is more cost and time-effective, as you don’t need to annotate and label as much data. 
If you’re annotating enough data for a model to learn and it’s producing accurate results through an iterative process to come to the ground truth, you can achieve a production-ready model more quickly.
Before we go in-depth into self-supervised learning, it’s useful to compare it with the two main alternatives: supervised and unsupervised learning.
Supervised Learning requires training an artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), computer vision (CV), or another algorithmically-generated model on high-quality labeled and annotated data. This labeled data is fed into the model in a supervised fashion, whereby human ML engineers are training it through an iterative feedback loop. 
Unsupervised Learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the model attempts to find patterns and relationships in the data without being given explicit feedback in the form of labels.
Self-Supervised Learning is an ML-based training format and a range of methods that encourage a model to train from unlabeled data. Foundation models and visual foundation models (VFMs) are usually trained this way, not reliant on labeled data.
Unsupervised learning is focused on grouping, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. In many ways, this makes SSL a subset of unsupervised learning. However, there are differences in the outputs of the two formats.
Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, performs segmentation, classification, and regression tasks, similar to supervised learning. 
There are other approaches, too, such as semi-supervised learning, which sits between supervised and unsupervised learning. However, we will leave semi-supervised learning as the topic for another article on model training and learning methods.
Computer vision models need self-supervised learning because they often require large amounts of labeled data to train effectively. Sourcing, annotating, and labeling this data can be difficult and expensive to obtain.
Especially in highly-specialized sectors, such as healthcare, where medical professionals are needed to annotate and label data accurately. 
Self-supervised learning can provide an alternative to labeling large amounts of data - a costly and time-consuming task, even when you’re using automated data labeling systems. Instead, this allows the models to learn from the data itself and improve their accuracy without the need for vast amounts of labels and annotations.
Computer vision and other algorithmically-generated models also perform better when each category of labeled data has an equal number of samples. Otherwise, bias creeps into the model’s performance. 
Unfortunately, if a category of images or videos is hard to obtain (unless you invest in synthetic data creation or data augmentation), it can prove difficult to source enough data to improve performance. 
Self-supervised learning reduces or eliminates the need to label and annotate data for computer vision models. While simultaneously reducing the need for augmentation and synthetic image or video creation in the case of computer vision.
