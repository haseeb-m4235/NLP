Detection and localization of regions of images that attract immediate human visual attention is currently an intensive area of research in computer vision. The capability of automatic identification and segmentation of such salient image regions has immediate consequences for applications in the field of computer vision, computer graphics, and multimedia. A large number of salient object detection (SOD) methods have been devised to effectively mimic the capability of the human visual system to detect the salient regions in images. These methods can be broadly categorized into two categories based on their feature engineering mechanism: conventional or deep learning-based. In this survey, most of the influential advances in image-based SOD from both conventional as well as deep learning-based categories have been reviewed in detail. Relevant saliency modeling trends with key issues, core techniques, and the scope for future research work have been discussed in the context of difficulties often faced in salient object detection. Results are presented for various challenging cases for some large-scale public datasets. Different metrics considered for assessment of the performance of state-of-the-art salient object detection models are also covered. Some future directions for SOD are presented towards end.
The behavior of SOD models is expected to mimic the pre-attentive stage of HVS which guides human attention to the highly interesting regions in the scene. The identified salient regions in images can facilitate subsequent high-level vision tasks for improved efficiency and optimal resource usage. As a preprocessing step, SOD has served many computer vision tasks such as, visual tracking, image captioning, image/video segmentation , and so forth.
The challenges and difficulties in SOD come from the very nature of the scenes captured in free viewing conditions. Several sample images from different SOD datasets can be seen in Figure 1. The accompanying pixel-wise annotations shown here are used for evaluation but clearly delineate the basic requirements for a salient object detector. A SOD method should keep the error metric values to their least by strictly attaining to the salient regions and missing the non-salient ones. It is further expected that the SOD method should be computationally inexpensive in producing a high resolution saliency map for accurate salient object localization . Being an active research field over the past two decades, a large number of models have been attempted to satisfy the minimum requirements for image based SOD. Early efforts for saliency detection were focused at fixation prediction. Fixation prediction aims to attend the spatial locations where an observer may fixate within few seconds of free-viewing. SOD is different from fixation prediction as models for the former should detect and segment the entire extent of salient regions/objects in the scene. A general approach adopted by conventional SOD models to accomplish this goal is to assign high probability values to salient elements in a scene while producing a saliency map. Once detected, techniques such as thresholding can be used to segment out the whole salient object. Conventional SOD models following Itti et al. attempt to capture the notion of scene rarity or uniqueness mainly by devising center-surround contrast features. Regional contrast in terms of global and local schemes have been frequently used in conventional SOD. Various complementary heuristic saliency priors have also been deployed to effectively capture the most conspicuous object regions in images. These conventional models have been proven to be efficient and effective in relatively simple scenes with a single object and/or clean background.
Many diverse datasets have surfaced in the past ten years to challenge these SOD models. The presence of multiple salient objects, heterogeneous salient objects with variations in shape, size and position, low-contrast objects, and much cluttered background in datasets are challenging issues to address while adhering to high prediction requirements of SOD. However, the recent rapid development of deep learning-based techniques in the field has been highly successful in tackling most of the aforementioned issues. Fully convolution neural networks (FCN) lies at the core of deep learning-based SOD. The powerful hierarchical multi-scale feature representation of FCN has been utilized in various ways for a coarse saliency prediction and its refinement for boundary accurate saliency map in a data-driven manner. However, the conventional models for SOD have the advantage of providing real-time performance and can be applied in the wild. Meanwhile, several deep models have leveraged saliency priors to improve the representational ability of multi-layer features and to speed-up the training process. Wang et al.combined saliency estimate of multiple conventional methods as the prior knowledge informative of salient regions to guide saliency detection. Chen et al.[12] utilize saliency priors as an initial prediction for saliency refinement. Zhang et. al. devised a deep unsupervised saliency detection with noisy supervision from multiple conventional SODs. Simple heuristic operator such as contrast in Reference has been adopted for contrast modelling of multi-scale features in References. These adaptations suggest that despite tremendous progress and superior performance demonstrated by deep learning based SOD, the tools of conventional saliency detection can be useful for further raising the performance bar of deep models.
