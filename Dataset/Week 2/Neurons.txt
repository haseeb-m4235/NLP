Text: <An artificial neuron is a mathematical function. It takes one or more inputs that are multiplied by values called “weights” and added together. This value is then passed to a non-linear function, known as an activation function, to become the neuron’s output.
Neurons in deep learning models are nodes through which data and computations flow.
They receive one or more input signals. These input signals can come from either the raw data set or from neurons positioned at a previous layer of the neural net.They perform some calculations.
They send some output signals to neurons deeper in the neural net through a synapse.
neurons in a deep learning model are capable of having synapses that connect to more than one neuron in the preceding layer. Each synapse has an associated weight, which impacts the preceding neuron’s importance in the overall neural network.
Weights are a very important topic in the field of deep learning because adjusting a model’s weights is the primary way through which deep learning models are trained. 
Once a neuron receives its inputs from the neurons in the preceding layer of the model, it adds up each signal multiplied by its corresponding weight and passes them on to an activation function.
The activation function calculates the output value for the neuron. This output value is then passed on to the next layer of the neural network through another synapse.>
