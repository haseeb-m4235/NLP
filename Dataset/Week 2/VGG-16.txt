Text: <A convolutional neural network is also known as a ConvNet, which is a kind of artificial neural network. A convolutional neural network has an input layer, an output layer, and various hidden layers. VGG16 is a type of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is considered to be one of the best computer vision models to date. The creators of this model evaluated the networks and increased the depth using an architecture with very small (3 × 3) convolution filters, which showed a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations. They pushed the depth to 16–19 weight layers making it approx — 138 trainable parameters.
VGG16 is object detection and classification algorithm which is able to classify 1000 images of 1000 different categories with 92.7% accuracy. It is one of the popular algorithms for image classification and is easy to use with transfer learning.
The 16 in VGG16 refers to 16 layers that have weights. In VGG16 there are thirteen convolutional layers, five Max Pooling layers, and three Dense layers which sum up to 21 layers but it has only sixteen weight layers i.e., learnable parameters layer.
VGG16 takes input tensor size as 224, 244 with 3 RGB channel
Most unique thing about VGG16 is that instead of having a large number of hyper-parameters they focused on having convolution layers of 3x3 filter with stride 1 and always used the same padding and maxpool layer of 2x2 filter of stride 2.
The convolution and max pool layers are consistently arranged throughout the whole architecture
Conv-1 Layer has 64 number of filters, Conv-2 has 128 filters, Conv-3 has 256 filters, Conv 4 and Conv 5 has 512 filters.
Three Fully-Connected (FC) layers follow a stack of convolutional layers: the first two have 4096 channels each, the third performs 1000-way ILSVRC classification and thus contains 1000 channels (one for each class). The final layer is the soft-max layer.
The process of training VGG is similar to that of AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al.). They both involve  optimizing a multinomial logistic regression function to achieve backpropagation. VGG uses mini-batches to avoid a vanishing gradient that arises due to the depth of the network.
During training, the batch size was set to be 256, while the momentum was set to be 0.9. The VGG model introduced dropout regularization in two of the fully connected layers, with the dropout ratio set to 0.5. The network’s initial learning rate was 0.001. When the accuracy of the validation set stopped improving, the learning rate decreased by a factor of 10. The learning rate dropped three times, and training ended after 74 epochs (370,000 iterations).
It took 2-3 weeks to train a VGG network using 4 NVIDIA Titan Black GPUs on the ILSVRC dataset on 1.3 million training images.
The VGG16 network far outperformed previous models in the ILSVRC-2012 and 2013 competitions in an image classification task. The VGG16 architecture achieved the best results in terms of single net performance (7.0% test error). 
The two main drawbacks of using VGG are its long training time and large model size of 500MB. Modern architectures use skip connections and inceptions to reduce the number of trainable parameters, improving both accuracy and training time.
