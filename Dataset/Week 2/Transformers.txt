Paragraph text "A transformer is a deep learning architecture, initially proposed in 2017, that relies on the parallel multi-head attention mechanism. It is notable for requiring less training time than previous recurrent neural architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), and its later variation has been prevalently adopted for training large language models on large (language) datasets, such as the Wikipedia corpus and Common Crawl, by virtue of the parallelized processing of input sequence. Input text is split into n-grams encoded as tokens and each token is converted into a vector via looking up from a word embedding table. At each layer, each token is then contextualized within the scope of the context window with other (unmasked) tokens via a parallel multi-head attention mechanism allowing the signal for key tokens to be amplified and less important tokens to be diminished. Though the transformer paper was published in 2017, the softmax-based attention mechanism was proposed in 2014 for machine translation, and the Fast Weight Controller, similar to a transformer, was proposed in 1992.
This architecture is now used not only in natural language processing and computer vision,[9] but also in audio and multi-modal processing. It has also led to the development of pre-trained systems, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
The transformer model has been implemented in standard deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Transformers is a library produced by Hugging Face that supplies transformer-based architectures and pretrained models.
Like earlier seq2seq models, the original transformer model used an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder consists of encoding layers that process the input tokens iteratively one layer after another, while the decoder consists of decoding layers that iteratively process the encoder's output as well as the decoder output's tokens so far.
The function of each encoder layer is to generate contextualized token representations, where each representation corresponds to a token that "mixes" information from other input tokens via self-attention mechanism. Each decoder layer contains two attention sublayers: (1) cross-attention for incorporating the output of encoder (contextualized input token representations), and (2) self-attention for "mixing" information among the input tokens to the decoder (i.e., the tokens generated so far during inference time).
Both the encoder and decoder layers have a feed-forward neural network for additional processing of the outputs and contain residual connections and layer normalization steps."
