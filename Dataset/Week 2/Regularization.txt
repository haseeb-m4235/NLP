Text "A universal problem in machine learning has been making an algorithm that performs equally well on training data and any new samples or test dataset. Techniques used in machine learning that have specifically been designed to cater to reducing test error, mostly at the expense of increased training error, are globally known as regularization.
Regularization may be defined as any modification or change in the learning algorithm that helps reduce its error over a test dataset, commonly known as generalization error but not on the supplied or training dataset.

In learning algorithms, there are many variants of regularization techniques, each of which tries to cater to different challenges. These can be listed down straightforwardly based on the kind of challenge the technique is trying to deal with:

1. Some try to put extra constraints on the learning of an ML model, like adding restrictions on the range/type of parameter values.
2. Some add more terms in the objective or cost function, like a soft constraint on the parameter values. More often than not, a careful selection of the right constraints and penalties in the cost function contributes to a massive boost in the model's performance, specifically on the test dataset.
3. These extra terms can also be encoded based on some prior information that closely relates to the dataset or the problem statement.
4. One of the most commonly used regularization techniques is creating ensemble models, which take into account the collective decision of multiple models, each trained with different samples of data.
5. The main aim of regularization is to reduce the over-complexity of the machine learning models and help the model learn a simpler function to promote generalization."
