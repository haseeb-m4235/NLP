TEXT: Batch normalization (also known as batch norm) is a method used to make training of artificial neural networks faster and more stable through normalization of the layers' inputs by re-centering and re-scaling. It was proposed by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy in 2015.
While the effect of batch normalization is evident, the reasons behind its effectiveness remain under discussion. It was believed that it can mitigate the problem of internal covariate shift, where parameter initialization and changes in the distribution of the inputs of each layer affect the learning rate of the network. Recently, some scholars have argued that batch normalization does not reduce internal covariate shift, but rather smooths the objective function, which in turn improves the performance. However, at initialization, batch normalization in fact induces severe gradient explosion in deep networks, which is only alleviated by skip connections in residual networks.Others maintain that batch normalization achieves length-direction decoupling, and thereby accelerates neural networks.
Each layer of a neural network has inputs with a corresponding distribution, which is affected during the training process by the randomness in the parameter initialization and the randomness in the input data. The effect of these sources of randomness on the distribution of the inputs to internal layers during training is described as internal covariate shift. Although a clear-cut precise definition seems to be missing, the phenomenon observed in experiments is the change on means and variances of the inputs to internal layers during training.
Batch normalization was initially proposed to mitigate internal covariate shift. During the training stage of networks, as the parameters of the preceding layers change, the distribution of inputs to the current layer changes accordingly, such that the current layer needs to constantly readjust to new distributions. This problem is especially severe for deep networks, because small changes in shallower hidden layers will be amplified as they propagate within the network, resulting in significant shift in deeper hidden layers. Therefore, the method of batch normalization is proposed to reduce these unwanted shifts to speed up training and to produce more reliable models.
Besides reducing internal covariate shift, batch normalization is believed to introduce many other benefits. With this additional operation, the network can use higher learning rate without vanishing or exploding gradients. Furthermore, batch normalization seems to have a regularizing effect such that the network improves its generalization properties, and it is thus unnecessary to use dropout to mitigate overfitting. It has also been observed that the network becomes more robust to different initialization schemes and learning rates while using batch normalization.
Although batch normalization has become popular due to its strong empirical performance, the working mechanism of the method is not yet well-understood. The explanation made in the original paper was that batch norm works by reducing internal covariate shift, but this has been challenged by more recent work. One experiment trained a VGG-16 network under 3 different training regimes: standard (no batch norm), batch norm, and batch norm with noise added to each layer during training. In the third model, the noise has non-zero mean and non-unit variance, i.e. it explicitly introduces covariate shift. Despite this, it showed similar accuracy to the second model, and both performed better than the first, suggesting that covariate shift is not the reason that batch norm improves performance.
Since it is hypothesized that batch normalization layers could reduce internal covariate shift, an experiment[citation needed] is set up to measure quantitatively how much covariate shift is reduced. First, the notion of internal covariate shift needs to be defined mathematically. Specifically, to quantify the adjustment that a layer's parameters make in response to updates in previous layers, the correlation between the gradients of the loss before and after all previous layers are updated is measured, since gradients could capture the shifts from the first-order training method. If the shift introduced by the changes in previous layers is small, then the correlation between the gradients would be close to 1.
The correlation between the gradients are computed for four models: a standard VGG network, a VGG network with batch normalization layers, a 25-layer deep linear network (DLN) trained with full-batch gradient descent, and a DLN network with batch normalization layers. Interestingly, it is shown that the standard VGG and DLN models both have higher correlations of gradients compared with their counterparts, indicating that the additional batch normalization layers are not reducing internal covariate shift.
