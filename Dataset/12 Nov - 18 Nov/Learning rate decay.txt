Text: <While training neural networks with Stochastic or Mini Batch Gradient Descent and a constant learning rate our algorithm usually converges towards minima in a noisy manner ( less noisier in MBGD) and end up oscillating far away from actual minima , to overcome this scenario researchers bring up a proposal to decay the learning rate over time which helps the network converge to a local minimum and avoid oscillation.
Learning rate decay is a technique for training modern neural networks. It starts training the network with a large learning rate and then slowly reducing/decaying it until local minima is obtained. It is empirically observed to help both optimization and generalization.
The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated. Choosing the learning rate is challenging as a value too small may result in a long training process that could get stuck, whereas a value too large may result in learning a sub-optimal set of weights too fast or an unstable training process.
Stochastic gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that estimates the error gradient for the current state of the model using examples from the training dataset, then updates the weights of the model using the back-propagation of errors algorithm, referred to as simply backpropagation.
The amount that the weights are updated during training is referred to as the step size or the “learning rate.”
Specifically, the learning rate is a configurable hyperparameter used in the training of neural networks that has a small positive value, often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0.
The learning rate controls how quickly the model is adapted to the problem. Smaller learning rates require more training epochs given the smaller changes made to the weights each update, whereas larger learning rates result in rapid changes and require fewer training epochs.
A learning rate that is too large can cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, whereas a learning rate that is too small can cause the process to get stuck.
The challenge of training deep learning neural networks involves carefully selecting the learning rate. It may be the most important hyperparameter for the model.>
