It was first introduced in 2014 and is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. The name “Adam” stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, which refers to its adaptive learning rate and moment estimation capabilities.

The Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm in machine learning, particularly in deep learning applications. It combines the benefits of two other optimization techniques – Momentum and Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) – to provide an efficient and adaptive update of model parameters. By computing both first-order momentum (moving average of gradients) and second-order moment (moving average of squared gradients) of the loss function, Adam adjusts the learning rate for each parameter individually, ensuring a smooth and fast convergence. This optimization technique has gained popularity because of its adaptive learning rates, robustness to noise, and suitability for handling sparse gradients, making it a go-to choice for training various machine learning models, including neural networks.
